# 💱 Currency Tracking System

This repository contains a **Java-based project** that I developed during my internship to learn and practice **data fetching, database handling, and reporting**.  

The project demonstrates how to retrieve **daily currency rates from TCMB (Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey)**, process the data, store it in a **MySQL database**, and generate reports to compare exchange rates.

## 🏢 Project Overview

During my internship as a **Software Developer**, I applied theoretical knowledge in practical tasks:

- Fetching **XML data** from an external API (TCMB)  
- Parsing XML using **DOM Parser** to extract currency rates  
- Listing all available currencies to the user and allowing selection  
- Storing selected currency values in **MySQL** using **JDBC**  
- Calculating differences between today’s and previous day’s rates  
- Generating a simple **console-based report**
