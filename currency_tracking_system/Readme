## 🔹 Project Overview

This project is a **Java application** that fetches **daily exchange rates** from the **Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB)**, lists them to the user, stores the selected currency in a **MySQL database**, and generates a **report comparing today’s and yesterday’s rates**.  

It was developed as a **learning-focused project** during my internship to practice **data fetching, processing, and reporting**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Fetch XML-based currency rates from TCMB  
- 📋 List all available currencies and allow user selection  
- 💾 Store selected currency data in MySQL  
- 📊 Calculate and display the difference between today’s and yesterday’s rates  
- 🖥️ Console-based reporting for quick analysis  

---

## 💡 Key Learning Points

- **Java Programming:** OOP, exception handling, collections, I/O operations  
- **Database Integration:** Using MySQL and JDBC for storing and retrieving data  
- **Data Processing:** Parsing XML with DOM Parser, converting string to numeric values  
- **User Interaction:** Console input for selecting currencies  
- **Reporting Logic:** Comparing daily currency rates programmatically

## 🛠 Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Java 17+ | Core programming |
| MySQL 8+ | Database storage |
| JDBC | Java-MySQL connectivity |
| DOM Parser | XML parsing |
| IntelliJ IDEA | Development IDE |

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Some currency values in the XML may be empty, which could cause parsing errors  
- Running the program multiple times in the same day may create **duplicate records**  
- Future improvements: saving console reports to **Excel, CSV, or PDF**, or adding a **GUI/web interface**

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Automatically store all currencies in the database  
- Generate detailed report files (Excel, PDF, CSV)  
- Add GUI for better user experience  

---

## 📌 Summary

This project **demonstrates practical application** of Java, database handling, and data processing skills learned during my internship.  
It shows how **real-world data fetching, storing, and reporting** can be implemented in a simple and effective console-based application.
